## `is` and `==`  operators

* [6. Expressions — Python 3.8.2 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#is)
* [Understanding Python’s “is” operator - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13650293/understanding-pythons-is-operator/13650309#13650309)

The *is operator* compares the *identity* of two objects while the *== operator* compares the *values* of two objects. There is a difference in meaning between equal and identical. And this difference is important when you want to understand how Python’s is and == *comparison operators* behave.
The *== operator* is used when the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.
The *is operator* evaluates to true if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same object and false otherwise.
